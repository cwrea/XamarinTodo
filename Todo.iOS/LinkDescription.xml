        LinkDescription.xml. File added to iOS project by @cwrea for adaptation to EF Core.
        
        Prevents runtime errors when reflection is used for certain types that are not otherwise referenced
        directly in the project, and that would be removed by the Xamarin linker.
        
        These kinds of runtime errors do occur in particular when using Entity Framework Core on iOS. EF Core's
        query parser does reference certain .NET methods _only_ via reflection, and it is those reflection-only
        instances that we need to guard against by ensuring the linker includes them. For the curious, search
        for mentions of "GetRuntimeMethod" at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework. Use of EF Core more
        advanced than this sample may require additional types/methods added to those below.
